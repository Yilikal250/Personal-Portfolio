<<<<<<< popup
> I have added a popup on the menu and 
    
    When the user clicks (or taps) the button to check project details, the popup with details about the project appears.
    When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the popup disappears.
    For each project i have  stored the following pieces of data in a JavaScript object, at a minimum: name, description, featured image, technologies, link to source.
    You need to update the main page so that the projects section is created dynamically using the information stored in that JavaScript object. Remember, all of the HTML in that section is created when the page loads.
=======
> I have added email validation on the form  
    
    
    When the user submits the form, you check if the email is in lower case.
    If the validation is OK, the form is sent.
    If the validation is not OK, you show an error message to the user near the submit button informing them of the error and the form is not sent.
