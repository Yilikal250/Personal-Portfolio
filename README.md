# Personal-Portfolio
> This is a personal portfolio containing the details of the projects i have worked and participated on and my contacs

> I have added a popup on the menu and 
    
    When the user clicks (or taps) the button to check project details, the popup with details about the project appears.
    When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the popup disappears.
    For each project i have  stored the following pieces of data in a JavaScript object, at a minimum: name, description, featured image, technologies, link to source.
    You need to update the main page so that the projects section is created dynamically using the information stored in that JavaScript object. Remember, all of the HTML in that section is created when the page loads.
